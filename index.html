            <h2>Why a Dachshund?</h2>
            <h3>About the Breed...</h3>
            <p>
              Dachshunds have a rich history dating back to 15th century Europe.
              Originally bred in Germany, their name literally translates to
              "badger dog", a nod to their primary role as hunters. Their
              elongated bodies and short legs were specially tailored for
              navigating through tight underground tunnels. Over time,
              Dachshunds have evolved into beloved companions known for their
              distinctive looks, personality, and stubborness.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are loyal almost to fault, extremely curious, very lazy (yet
              extremely energetic), and are absolute comedians. If they have any
              cons, it would be related to stubborness. They have selective
              hearing and genuinely do what they want, when they want.
              Also...good luck getting them to use the bathroom outside when its
              raining. You'll both be wet by the end of that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, they are incredible dogs. You will be followed everywhere
              you go, but your life will be filled with love and laughter with a
              ween around.
